**Description**

To facilitate automatic handling of the electrode holder and enable seamless transitions between sample preparation and electrochemical testing without manual intervention, we developed an alternative mechanism. In this design, electrodes are carried in a 1000 uL pipette tip instead, as illustrated in the figure below. The tip can be installed in the pipette rack and be picked up automatically by the OT-2 platform when needed like a regular pipette tip. While this mechanism was not employed to generate results in this work, it was successfully tested and proved capable of supporting autonomous experiments and remote operation. Using a multi-pipette head this could be extended to multiple electrode holders operating in parallel and feeding to multi-channel potentiostat to increase throughput of electrochemical testing.
