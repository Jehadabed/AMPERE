**Description**

In this work, we made an electrode holder that attaches to the OT-2 pipette head to move between samples during electrochemical testing. We crafted a bracket that securely clasps around one of the OT-2 pipettes using plastic screws, enabling the attachment of electrodes at the holder's end as shown in the figure below. During the experiment, the pipette head remains fully extended and does not retract. The holder is manually installed and removed following the sample preparation for electrochemical testing. This design enables the attachment of multiple electrodes to the bracketâ€™s end allowing parallel electrochemical tests.
