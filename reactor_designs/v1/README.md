**Description**

The base plate of the reactor is CNC milled from a sheet of high-density polyethylene. According to the attached drawings, all the 3.5052mm screw holes (highlighted in red) are taped to 6-32 UNC. The neodymium magnets are placed in the 4.763mm holes (highlighted in orange) with the north side facing up. The base plate is used to hold the substrate. We have used carbon paper and fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass as substrates in this work but virtually any material that can conduct electricity on the surface can be used.

The top piece of the reactor is CNC milled from a sheet of polyether ether ketone (PEEK). The neodymium magnets are placed in the 4.763mm holes (highlighted in orange) with the south side facing down. The reactor is placed on top of the base plate, which is holding the substrate, aligned with the magnets and secured with the bolts. An O-ring (highlighted in green) is used to seal the cells and prevent electrolyte leakage. While strong magnets can be used to hold the reactor on top of the baseplate, we have found that they can sometimes loosen over extended periods, leading to potential electrolyte leakage. To maintain sufficient compression and prevent leakage, we incorporated bolts into the design. We recommend using both magnets for initial alignment of the cell and bolts to ensure a secure compression.
