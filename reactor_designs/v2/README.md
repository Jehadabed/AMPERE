**Description**

This design allows the use of individual substrates instead of a single substrate slide. A conductor sheet is sandwiched between the top piece and the base plate to enable electron conduction through the top surface of the substrates. In addition to the inner O-ring used in the previous design, an additional outer O-ring (highlighted in purple) is added to push the conductor sheet against the substrate and maintain sufficient compression for electrical conduction.
